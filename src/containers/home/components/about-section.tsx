          <p>
            In chess, Pawn is the least important, but it ca&apos;t be missing in the board. Sometimes, it can decide the
            result of the match. And the employee likes me is the same as the Pawn. Have the potentials, but doesn&apos;t
            know how to explore, that&apos;s why the Pawn needs the guide to promote. For now, I am just the Pawn, but in the
            future, I can be the Bishop, Knight or Rook.

            My journey to become a Frontend Website Developer is miracle. I didn&apos;t try programming till joined
            university and I regret not starting earlier. When tried to create a website using HTML, I enjoyed and decided to
            pursue seriously. I believe within 2-3 years after graduation, I will become the skilled developer and gain
            extensive experience
